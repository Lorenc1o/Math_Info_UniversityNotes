Here you can find my Bachelor's Thesis for the BSc in Computer Science, as well as a presentation of the work.
It is called 'Un modelo en elementos finitos para estudiar las deformaciones del tejido mamario' and it is written in Spanish, but in the section *Extended Abstract* you can read a fairly deep explanation of the work done.
If you have any doubts, do not hesitate to message me either in GitHub or by email.
